## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore)  
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture pattern  
- **State Management**: Bloc  

## Home Screen Description

The home screen automatically fetches the user's current location (latitude and longitude) using device GPS.  
This location data is then used to make a query to a weather API to retrieve current weather conditions, including:

- Temperature  
- Weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)  
- Location name (e.g., city)

In addition to the current weather, the screen also displays **a weekly weather forecast**, allowing the user to view upcoming weather conditions for the next 7 days in a horizontal timeline.

A logout button is also available with confirmation before signing out.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository  
2. Add your Firebase config files  
3. Run `flutter pub get`  
4. Launch with `flutter run`  

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed weather info (wind, humidity, pressure)  
- Implement user preferences (unit settings, themes)  
- Add daily/hourly toggle
